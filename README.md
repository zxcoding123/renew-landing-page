🎧 FoCi
Find your flow in the depth of sound.

FoCi is a minimalist productivity environment designed to drown out the noise of the world. Unlike standard lo-fi playlists, FoCi focuses on deep frequency soundscapes—brown noise, low-end atmospheric drones, and rhythmic pulses—specifically engineered to enhance cognitive endurance and deep work.

✨ The Philosophy
Most productivity apps focus on managing time. FoCi focuses on protecting it. By utilizing deep-frequency audio, the app helps:

Mask environmental distractions (office chatter, traffic, humming electronics).

Reduce cognitive load by providing a consistent, non-intrusive auditory anchor.

Induce Flow States faster through curated "Deep Sound" profiles.

🛠️ Key Features
🔊 Curated Sound Engine
A library of high-fidelity, seamless loops including:

Deep Brown Noise: For heavy masking and anxiety reduction.

Subterranean Hum: Low-frequency drones for intense coding or writing sessions.

Atmospheric Textures: Subtle, non-melodic layers like distant rain or heavy wind.

🎚️ Minimalist Mixer
Layer different deep sounds to create your perfect acoustic environment. Save your favorite "Focus Profiles" for different tasks.

⏱️ Deep Work Timer
An integrated, non-intrusive timer that tracks your focus sessions without jarring alarms. It fades sounds in and out to gently transition you between work and rest.
